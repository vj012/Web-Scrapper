In this Project I scraped using bs4 to get the Captcha image url from the page.
Then python program used  pytesseract OCR library to convert Digital images into machine-encoded text.
Python-tesseract is an optical character recognition (OCR) tool for python. 
That is, it will recognize and “read” the text embedded in images.
The library could be installed onto our python environment by executing the following command in the command interpreter of the OS:-

pip install pytesseract

Import the Image module from PIL library (for opening an image) and then pytesseract module from pytesseract library(for text extraction). 
First The image url is passed as a parameter to the open() function to create an image object out of the image. 
This created an image object which is passed to image_to_string() function. 
This function takes in argument an image object and returns the text recognized inside it. 
In the end, the text which was found in the image was diaplayed and entered using selenium in the input element of the website.
